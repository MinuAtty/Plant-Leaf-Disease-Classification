# Plant Leaf Disease Classification üåø


This project employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately classify diseases affecting plant leaves. By training on large datasets of diseased and healthy leaf images, the CNN model learns to distinguish between different types of diseases with high precision. Leveraging the power of deep learning, this project aims to assist farmers and agronomists in early detection and management of plant diseases, ultimately contributing to higher crop yields and sustainable agriculture practices.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Disease Classification**: Predicts whether a plant leaf is healthy, affected by powdery mildew, or rust disease.
- **Image Upload**: Allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf for classification.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a pre-trained CNN model fine-tuned for plant disease detection.
- **Visualization**: Displays the uploaded image and prediction results with confidence scores.
